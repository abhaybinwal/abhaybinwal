<h1 align="center">Hi , I'm Abhay Binwal</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am an aspiring Network Security Engineer with strong hands-on skills in routing, switching, and firewalls, and recently earned my CCNP SCOR 350-701 certification. My technical expertise includes configuring Cisco ASA firewalls, implementing VPN technologies (IPSec, DMVPN, FlexVPN, AnyConnect), and working on routing/switching fundamentals using lab environments such as Cisco Packet Tracer and EVE-NG.

I also have foundational knowledge of Cisco ISE (Identity Services Engine), Cisco WSA/ESA (Web & Email Security Appliances), and Palo Alto Firewalls, with exposure to their basic concepts and configurations in lab setups. While I havenâ€™t yet worked with these technologies in a production environment, my practice and study have given me a solid understanding of their role in enterprise security.

Before transitioning into networking, I worked as a Business Analyst at Enverus (Oil & Energy domain), where I gained valuable corporate experience in data analysis, problem-solving, business communication, and agile team collaboration. This background strengthens my technical skills by adding analytical thinking and the ability to communicate insights effectively â€” qualities that are critical in network troubleshooting and security operations.

I am passionate about building a career in network security engineering, contributing to secure network designs, implementing firewall and VPN solutions, and continuously learning to stay ahead of evolving threats.

Core Skills:
Routing & Switching (EIGRP, OSPF, VLANs, STP, EtherChannel, HSRP, VRRP, Inter-VLAN Routing)
Security (Cisco ASA, VPNs, Firewalls, ISE, WSA, ESA, Palo Alto)
Network Services (ACL, NAT/PAT, DHCP, DNS, ARP)
Troubleshooting & Packet Flow Analysis
Tools: Cisco CLI, MS Excel, SQL
